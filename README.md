# project-hashmap

This is an assignment from The Odin Project. The aim is to practice implementing hash maps by creating a HashMap class or factory function, then adding methods and test the hash map.

To run the tests, type:

node hashMapTest.js

in the Terminal (Node is required). It will log the number of entries, load factor, and number of items per bucket.
